Welcome to **knowledge**, a book by Joel JucÃ¡. If you're reading the online version, use the menu on the left side to browse the content.

## What?

This book contains things I learned during my life, either while studying or living. Most of its contents are not properly organized. The reading experience is not linear, so feel free to jump directly to sections you feel more interested in.

## Why?

I always wanted to write a book with things I've been learning during my life, but it just never happened, simply because I generally don't have time and willingness to do it at the same time. ðŸ˜‚ But I still want to share. So, I'll be just writing down things, thoughts, techniques, etc., without too much effort on organization.

An unstructured version that gets published would be better than a well formatted one that never goes public.
