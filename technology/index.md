Technology is revolutionizing the human life.
Today, almost everything we do is now related to, or uses technology somehow.
We communicate, work, chill, cook, date, fall in love, cheat, overcome, explore,
learn, evolve, etc., all with technology.
Since this thing has created such deep roots in our species, powering us to do
things we never imagined before, it would be wise to think about it in order to,
at least, try to understand where we currently are and where we are heading to,
now as the coolest kids who ever lived on Earth.
