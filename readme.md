Welcome to **knowledge**, a book by Joel Wallis JucÃ¡.
If you're reading the online version, use the menu on the left side to browse
the content.

## What?

This book contains things I learned during my life, either while studying or
living.
Most of its contents are not properly organized.
The reading experience is not linear, so feel free to jump directly to sections
you feel more interested in.

## Why?

I always wanted to write a book with things I've been learning during my life,
but it just never happened, simply because I generally don't have time and
willingness to do it at the same time. ðŸ˜‚
But I still want to share.
So, I'll be just writing down things, thoughts, techniques, etc., without too
much effort on organization.

An unstructured version that gets published is way better than a well formatted
one that never goes public.
