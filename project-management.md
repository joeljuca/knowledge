# project management ✅
I've tried many different setups to manage projects: stickies, kanban, many
different apps and services, and I failed horribly at getting things done.
Now I have a quite simple setup:

- I use [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/) as my main to-do app, with
  lists for personal and professional things;
- ‎I generally add all projects and tasks I must/should do/perform to my
  Wunderlist as lists, so it is common to find lists with dozens of items;
- ‎Wunderlist has an interesting feature called _smart lists_ that group items
  from multiple lists based on its due date.
  I use them to see tasks for today and the current week;
- ‎My daily focus is always to get done all shit scheduled for today.
  Everything that can't be accomplished today will be postponed, either for
  tomorrow or later, so I can focus on what I can do today;
- ‎Since Wunderlist helps me to focus on my daily goals I have lists for sanzonal
  projects, like Dsafio, Exercism and HoraExtraJP alongside all their tasks
  (e.g.: issues to solve, pull requests to review, or events to organize);
- ‎Integration with my calendar helps me visualize my daily schedule together
  with compromises (planned working hours, meetings, as well as personal and
  professional appointments).
