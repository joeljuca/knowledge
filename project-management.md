# project management ✅
I've tried many different setups to manage projects.
Stickies, kanban, many different apps and services, and I failed horribly at
getting things done.
Now I have a quite simple setup:

- I use Wunderlist as my main to-do app, with lists for personal and
  professional things
- ‎I generally add all projects and tasks I must/should do/perform to these
  lists, so it is common to find lists with dozens of items;
- ‎Wunderlist has an interesting feature called _smart lists_, that group items
  from multiple lists based on its due date.
  I use the ones that shows tasks for today and this week;
- ‎My daily focus is to get done all shit scheduled for today.
  Everything that couldn't be accomplished today I'll postpone it, either for
  tomorrow or later, so I can focus on what I have to do today;
- ‎Since Wunderlist helps me to focus on my daily goals I have lists for sanzonal
  projects, like Dsafio, Exercism and HoraExtraJP;
- ‎Integration with my calendar helps me precisely visualize my daily schedule,
  together with compromises (planned working hours, meetings, as well as
    personal and professional appointments).
