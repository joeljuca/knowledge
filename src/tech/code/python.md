# python üêç

[Python](https://www.python.org/) ([Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)>)) is a general purpose programming language, one of the most famous PLs in the world, and definitely the lingua-franca of the data world (data science, machine learning, deep learning, etc.).

## Vocab

- **PyPI:** [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/). The website that hosts publicly available Python packages
- **Virtual environment:** a CLI trickery to overcome Python's inability to isolate project-specific dependencies

## Basic syntax and data types

Good syntax and basic data types overview available in [lxiym/python](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/)

## Virtual environments

- `venv`: it's a Python built-in module, a subset of `virtualenv` (another Python module, available on PyPi)
