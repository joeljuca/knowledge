Tips and tricks for the most insane code editor out there.

## ctrlp

Invoke it project-wide using `<Ctrl>P` or `:CtrlP`, or from a specific directory w/ `:CtrlP [directory name]`.

Once it's open:

- `<F5>` to refresh the cache (get new files, rm deleted ones, etc.)
- `<Ctrl>D` to switch between filepath-based and filename-based searching
- `<Ctrl>R` to switch to regex-based searching
