# ðŸª¶ [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org)

[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) is the most popular database in the world. Pretty much every fucking person in the world uses something that uses SQLite. However, it's generally considered a "toy database", often used for development purposes but not really considered as a possible solution to production usage.

In fact, it's easier to find people using ordinary data files (CSV, JSON, YAML, etc.) to store and organize larger amounts of data than to find people using SQLite for real-world scenarios. This is due to the fact that developers are often educated to use "production-grade databases" like MySQL or Postgres instead of SQLite â€“ which is unfortunate, because all these three options are production-grade tools, capable of serving different types of products.

Lately, I've attempting to adopt SQLite for serious workloads. I'm building an app that's intended for a wider audience, and I've adopted SQLite as my main database.

What a challenge! Let's see how far I can get with such embedded database.

## Using SQLite

SQLite databases are stored in a single file. Apparently there's no rule for how these are named, but [Wikipedia's SQLite page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite) lists the following file extensions: `.sqlite`, `.sqlite3`, `.db`, `.db3`, `.s3db`, and `.sl3` (MIME type is `application/vnd.sqlite3`).

CLI work is made through a CLI tool called `sqlite3`. Eg.:

```sh
sqlite3 database.sqlite
```

- To create an empty database, just create an empty file:
  ```
  touch database.sqlite
  ```
- To delete a database, delete the file:
  ```
  rm database.sqlite
  ```

## Dot-commands

The most important one: `.help` Eg.:

```
$ sqlite
SQLite version 3.41.2 2023-03-22 11:56:21                                                                                                                               [22/382]
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use ".open FILENAME" to reopen on a persistent database.

SQLite is unlike most popular relational databases due to it not being embedded instead of client-server.
