# xiaomi a1

I had one of these. Great phones!

## Hard-resetting A1s when you've lost access (password or pattern)

1. Turn off your A1
1. Press and hold `VolumeUp` and `Power` buttons until the Mi log appears
1. Release the buttons to boot in Stock Recovery (you should see a repairing robot and a message _"No command"_ in your phone screen)
1. Hold the `Power` button again and tap `VolumeUp` once
1. Use the volume buttons to scroll to the option _Wipe data/factory reset_
1. Select using the `Power` button
1. When it's finished, use the option _Reboot system now_ to reboot the phone

You should see the initial setup screens when it finishes rebooting.
