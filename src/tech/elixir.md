## Installing Phoenix

[Phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org/) is the most used Elixir framework for web development. Below is a series of commands required to install the Phoenix project bootstrapper (`mix phx.new`), extracted from its official documentation:

```sh
# Ensure Hex is installed
mix local.hex

# Installs the project bootstrapper
mix archive.install hex phx_new
```
