## Rebuilding Spotlight's cache

Whenever you find yourself struggling with Spotlight results being affected by past typos and having undesired first results for your typings, you can just reset the Spotlight cache.

To do it, go to System Preferences > Spotlight > Privacy, then add your disks to the search prevention list. It will force Spotlight to clear the cache of indexed items like docs, apps, etc. :-) After doing so, just remove the disks from the same list so the Spotlight's cache index can be rebuilt.
