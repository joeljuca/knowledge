I'm back on learning music, so I'll document here the stuff I've been learning.

## Music Theory 101

It's important to know what are the basic building blocks of music, right?

### Music Notes

The basic building block of music is a [note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_note). They are represented by English charaters A-G (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`, `F`, and `G`). We know them by the solfÃ¨ge _doâ€“reâ€“miâ€“faâ€“solâ€“laâ€“si_, which translates to the characters `C`, `D`, `E`, `F`, `G`, `A`, and `B` (it starts on `C` because it's the equivalent to _do_, with `D` being the equivalent to _re_, and so on).

Notes can be modified by accidentals, creating intermediary notes between each one. The [sharp sign](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_(music)>) (`#`) raises a note by a semitone (or half-step), while a [flat](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_(music)>) (or _bemolle_) lowers note by a semitone. So, c `C#` would be a note that exists between `C` and `D`, while `Eâ™­` would be a note that exists between `D` and `E`. It's also possible to have a semitone represented by two possible accidentals - for instance, the `C#` one could also be represented by `Dâ™­`. Since the sharp sign raises one semitone and bemolle lowers one semitone, the two representations are equivalent.

> Note: there are some special notes that does not have intermediary semitones. The `B` and `C`, and the `E` and `F`. These ones does not have semitones between them, so the semitones `B#`, `Câ™­`, `E#` and `Fâ™­` does not exist.

The full list of notes and sharp semitones would be:

> `C C# D D# E F F# G G# A A# B`

The equivalent full list of notes and flat semitones would be:

> `C Dâ™­ D Eâ™­ E F Gâ™­ G Aâ™­ A Bâ™­ B`

### Scales and Tetrachords

In music, a [scale](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(music)>) is an ordered set of musical notes. One of the most common scales is probably the [C Major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_major): `C`, `D`, `E`, `F`, `G`, `A` and `B`. It has no sharps or flats, and can easily be played on piano by just hitting the white keys starting on `C`.

A [tetrachord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrachord) is a set of four notes separated by three intervals. Tetrachords are the basic building blocks of a major scale, and its notes are systematically spaced by the following rule: _whole step_, _whole step_, _half step_, with a whole step separating the tetrachord from the second one. This way you can draw any major scale by just starting from a given note and following the tetrachord spacing order.

Using the tetrachord schema, I could describe the logic behind the C major with:

> C major (`C D E F G A B`): the first tetrachord goes one whole step (full note) from `C` to `D`, one whole step from `D` to `E`, and a half step (semitone only) from `E` to `F` (remember, there are no semitones between `E` and `F`). Then one whole step to start the second tetrachord at note `G`. Then, one whole step from `G` to `A`, one whole step from `A` to `B`, and one half step from `B` to `C` (again, there are no semitones between `B` and `C`).

Below are some other major scales I'm writing through the tetrachord system (I'm checking them on Wikipedia right after writing, and they are correct - yeah!):

- D major: `D E F# G A B C# D`
- E major: `E F# G# A B C# D# E`
- F major: `F G A A# C D E F`
- G major: `G A B C D E F# G`
- A major: `A B C# D E F# G# A`
- B major: `B C# D# E F# G# A# B`
